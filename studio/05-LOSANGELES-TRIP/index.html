      <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
        <p>The best times to visit Los Angeles are from March to May and between September and November, when the air is more breathable and the crowds are less oppressive. Average temperatures during these months range from the low 50s to low 80s, which makes walking around and visiting outdoor attractions much more comfortable. During the summer, average highs soar into the mid-80s; the heat coupled with heavy smog levels often drive visitors and residents alike to the already crowded oceanside neighborhoods. If you're looking for deals, consider a winter trip. Just make sure to pack an umbrella, since you're bound to encounter some rainfall in January and February.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.latourist.com/index.php?page=los-angeles-transportation">Los Angeles Transportation</a></h3>
      <p>The transportation system in Los Angeles is a complex multimodal infrastructure. It serves as a regional, national and international hub for passenger and freight traffic. </p>
	       <ul>•	Metro (Public buses and trains) -  Los Angeles has the second largest public transportation agency in the nation that operates more than 1,500 buses. We also have a subway system that can take you from Downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood in about 15 minutes! Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) operates the public buses and commuter trains within Los Angeles. The metro.net has extensive schedule information, trip planners and much more.</ul>
	       <ul>•	Taxi Service Area - There are about a dozen taxi cab companies in Los Angeles, but they are limited to pick up only in their authorized areas. So you will need to call the appropriate cab company, depending on where you want to be picked up. Follow the link for details, and phone numbers of official taxi cab companies in the various areas. </ul>
      <p>GPS navigators and mobile phones with GPS mapping are huge time savers in LA traffic and more efficient that paper maps, but are not always 100% accurate. In a few places, like traveling through the Malibu canyons or some parts of Griffith Park, you might hit a dead zone where you have no GPS access. </p>
