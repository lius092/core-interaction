      <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
      <p>The best time to visit New Mexico is in the fall, after the hot summer draws to an end and the kids go back to school. Many of the state's top annual events also take place in the late summer to fall. Winter vacationers typically hit Taos and other ski resorts in the mountainous northern region of the state between Christmas and March, while the desert areas in the south of New Mexico are particularly beautiful when the wildflowers erupt in bloom in the middle to late spring. </p>

      <p>The transportation system in New Mexico is extremely easy.</p>
	       <ul>•	Nine commercial airlines fly into the Albuquerque International Sunport (airport code: ABQ)</ul>
	       <ul>•	Albuquerque is a major stop for both Amtrak and Greyhound.</ul>
         <ul>•	There are numerous airport shuttle and rental car options for getting around the city.</ul>
         <ul>•	The NM Rail Runner commuter train makes day trips to Santa Fe and the surrounding communities easy.</ul>
         <ul>•	The highways I-25 and I-40 intersect in Albuquerque.</ul>
         <ul>•	The average city drive time is less than 20 minutes.</ul>
         <ul>•	The ABQ Ride public bus system includes the Rapid Ride along heavily traveled corridors.</ul>
      <p>GPS navigators and mobile phones with GPS mapping are huge time savers in New Mexico traffic and more efficient that paper maps, but are not always 100% accurate. In a few places, like traveling through the Malibu canyons or some parts of Griffith Park, you might hit a dead zone where you have no GPS access. </p>

        <ul>• Red chile is a sauce made with dried red chile pods or red chile powder, a liquid (water/stock), onion, garlic, and a little seasoning. It’s used to smother burritos, tostadas, stuffed sopapillas, and eggs. It’s THE enchilada sauce for New Mexico red chile enchiladas, as well as a spicy condiment for a bowl of beans, soup, or stew. It’s a staple product in many New Mexico kitchens.</ul>
        <ul>• New Mexico’s version of Mexican adobada is made for carnivores. Big chunks of pork are marinated overnight in red chile sauce and then slow-cooked for a few hours. The result is tender bites of spicy, meaty goodness. Carne adovada is usually served with beans and/or rice and a flour tortilla. It’s also used as the filling for enchiladas, stuffed into a sopapilla or burrito, or wrapped in a soft corn tortilla as a taco. The recipe linked below is a quick and modern method for making carne adovada, but it you want to follow the traditional process, you can use any red chile sauce for the overnight marinade and then slow-cook, covered in a 325°F oven, for 2-3 hours.</ul>
