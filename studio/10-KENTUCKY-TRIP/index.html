        <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
        <p>We recommend visiting Kentucky during the mid summer when temperatures are hot but room rates are cheaper. During this period, the cost of a room for two is $190/night on average. That's $20 less than what you would have paid in April. Average temperatures hover in the mid 80s, a lot warmer than the average 60°F you would get during peak season. The most popular time to travel to Kentucky is during the spring/early summer, which is comes with higher hotel rates. The Kentucky Derby 2018 week (May 2nd - 7th), the Bourbon & Beyond 2017 week (September 22nd - 25th) as well as the Forecastle week (July 14th - 17th) are also very popular periods, so expect the highest room rates of the year.</p>
