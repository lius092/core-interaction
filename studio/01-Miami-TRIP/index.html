      <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
      <p>January through April is Miami’s high season, as the regular influx of tourists prove.
      But budget-friendly (and crowd-wary) travelers are discovering the joys of the city’s quieter summer months, namely June through September.
      While it’s part of the so-called hurricane belt, making it vulnerable to inclement weather from June through November, as long as the sun is shining, Miami is open for business.</p>
      <h3>Miami Transportation</h3>
      <p>Miamians love their cars, and if you’re not renting a car, opt for taxi or car service. The Miami-Dade Transit system offers 800 Metrobuses that cost $2.25 per trip; the Metromover is free, electrically powered, and loops around Downtown and Brickell neighborhoods.</p>
      <h3>Miami Food</h3>
      <ul><li><strong><a href="http://www.naoemiami.com/">NAOE</a></strong> remains as my top (and only) choice for a possible three-star rating. In a category all by himself, Chef Cory excels at providing a dinner -to just eight guests at a time- unlike any other in the area. It’s hard to find a nigiri progression prepared like his elsewhere in South Florida: slowly, methodically, and expertly with the utmost respect to the ingredients. And yet somehow, NAOE is still a secret to many. </p></li></ul>
      <p><ul><li>In 2011 , <strong><a href="http://piedaterrerestaurant.com/">Pied A Terre</a></strong> restaurant opened its doors and became the soul and life of the historic cadet hotel, a fixture on Miami Beach since early 1942. To all our guests, Pied A Terre is a place to meet, remember flavors, create new ones and enjoy an exquisite culinary experience paired with exclusive wines in an environement of elegance.</p></ul></li>
