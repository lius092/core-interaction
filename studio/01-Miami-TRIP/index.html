        <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
        <p>The best time to visit Miami is the autumn and early winter season (October-December). The weather becomes pleasant with temperature ranging from 69 to 76 degrees Fahrenheit. This is an ideal time to enjoy beach activities and water sports. Planning your trip during this time will enable you to attend the Broadway Series show season that is launched during October. You will also be benefitted with comparatively low accommodation and food prices during this season. The month of November invites you to read and buy books during the Book Fair International and the Art Basel show in December is an important fine art show in the US that showcases amazing events for art lovers from around the world. </p>

      <h3>Miami Transportation</h3>
      <p>Miamians love their cars, and if you’re not renting a car, there are options for taxi or train service. The Metro mover is a free rail system that travels through and around the center of Miami’s shopping districts. It does not go to the airport, but there are rumors that it may in the future. The Metro Rail is a larger system reaching the outskirts of the city. The Metro Rail does travel to the airport. The fair is under 2 dollars.</p>

      <h3>Miami Restaurant Recommendation</h3>
      <p>1. <strong><a href="http://www.naoemiami.com/">NAOE</a></strong> remains as my top (and only) choice for a possible three-star rating. It’s hard to find a nigiri progression prepared like his elsewhere in South Florida: slowly, methodically, and expertly with the utmost respect to the ingredients.</p>
      <p>2. In 2011 , <strong><a href="http://piedaterrerestaurant.com/">Pied A Terre</a></strong> restaurant opened its doors and became the soul and life of the historic cadet hotel, a fixture on Miami Beach since early 1942. To all our guests, Pied A Terre is a place to meet, remember flavors, create new ones and enjoy an exquisite culinary experience paired with exclusive wines in an environement of elegance.</p>
