      <h1>Miami Travel Guide</h1>
      <hr />
      <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
      January through April is Miami’s high season, as the regular influx of tourists prove. <br />
      But budget-friendly (and crowd-wary) travelers are discovering the joys of the city’s quieter summer months, namely June through September. <br />
      While it’s part of the so-called hurricane belt, making it vulnerable to inclement weather from June through November, as long as the sun is shining, Miami is open for business.
      <h3>Miami Transportation</h3>
      Miamians love their cars, and if you’re not renting a car, opt for taxi or car service. <br />
      The Miami-Dade Transit system offers 800 Metrobuses that cost $2.25 per trip; the Metromover is free, electrically powered, and loops around Downtown and Brickell neighborhoods.
      <h3>Miami Food</h3>
      <ul><li><strong>NAOE</strong> remains as my top (and only) choice for a possible three-star rating. <br />
      In a category all by himself, Chef Cory excels at providing a dinner -to just eight guests at a time- unlike any other in the area. </br>
      It’s hard to find a nigiri progression prepared like his elsewhere in South Florida: slowly, methodically, and expertly with the utmost respect to the ingredients. <br />
      And yet somehow, NAOE is still a secret to many. <br />      <a href="http://www.naoemiami.com/">More Information</a><br /></li></ul>
      <ul><li>In 2011 , <strong>Pied a terre</strong> restaurant opened its doors and became the soul and life of the historic cadet hotel, a fixture on Miami Beach since early 1942. <br />
      To all our guests, Pied A Terre is a place to meet, remember flavors, create new ones and enjoy an exquisite culinary experience paired with exclusive wines in an environement of elegance.<br />
