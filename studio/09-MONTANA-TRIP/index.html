        <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
        <p>Travel to Montana, where rugged mountains meet vast prairies, and you'll gain new appreciation for the American frontier.Since Mother Nature acts as a museum here, it's easy to explore Native American culture, cowtown cities and battlefields, and experience untouched wilderness when you visit Montana.The ideal months for Montana travel are July and August, when the must-see attractions are up and running, the crowds are not overwhelming, and the temperature is most comfortable. The shoulder seasons - June or September - offer as much access as July and August, but come with two possible pitfalls in terms of weather: rain in June, and snow in September.</p>

      <h3>Montana Transportation</h3>
      <p>Transportation in Montana comprises many different forms of travel. Montana shares a long border with Canada, hence international crossings are prevalent in the northern section of the state; there are 13 road crossings and one rail crossing. As the fourth-largest state in the United States, journeying from one side to the other takes a long time. The state has an extensive network of roads, including state highways, Interstate highways and U.S. routes. Rail connections are also well-established and were an important method of transportation in Montana since the 1880s. Within individual cities, public transportation includes rapid transit and high-frequency bus services. For travel further afield, 16 airports are operational within Montana. Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Gallatin County is the busiest airport and there are another seven major airports and eight minor ones providing commercial services.</p>
