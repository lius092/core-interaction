        <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
        <p>Although the weather in Hawaii is quite pleasant year round, the tropical climate means that no two months are the same. Hawaii's dry season falls from April to October while the wet season occurs from November to March. Although summer sounds like the best time to travel to Hawaii, the conditions are actually very hot and humid and some visitors may find this uncomfortable. The best time to travel to Hawaii weather-wise is April, May, September and October and some great bargains can also be found around these times. The best time to travel to Hawaii also depends on which islands you'll be spending time on and each is different to the next.</p>

      <h3>Hawaii Transportation</h3>
      <p>Taxis are a great way to travel when in a group and the cost can be shared. You can find taxi stands at most major shopping centers, in the business district and at the airport. Note that rather than hailing a cab, finding taxi stands at major shopping centers and businesses as well as calling for pick-ups via hotel concierge or phone is the norm in Hawaii.</p>

      <h3>Hawaii Restaurant Recommendation</h3>
      <p>1. <strong><a href="http://www.chefmavro.com">Chef Mavro</a></strong> features fresh local seafood and produces as well as Niman Ranch lamb, Hudson Valley foie gras and Grimaud Farm duckling—all beautifully presented in a dining room painted the color of Provencal sunshine.</p>
      <p>2. <strong><a href="http://www.korestaurant.com">Ko.</a></strong> Executive Chef Tylun Pang draws inspiration from Hawaii’s sugarcane plantation era (Ko means sugarcane in Hawaiian) when workers from China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and Portugal arrived with their own culinary specialties.</p>
