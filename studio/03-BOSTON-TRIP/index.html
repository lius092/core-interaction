      <h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
      <p>The best time to visit Boston is from June to October. Mild fall weather makes touring around on foot a joy. And even though summer brings in swarms of tourists and expensive hotel rates, the sidewalk cafes, baseball games and outdoor concerts make it worth a trip. Winter is chilly, so pack a warm coat and a pair of boots if you decide to see Beantown sprinkled with snow. </p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.bostonusa.com/plan-your-trip/getting-around/">Boston Transportation</a></h3>
      <p>It may be "America's Walking City," but Boston also features an extensive transportation system to help you navigate smoothly, from Harvard to the Harbor. Use this section to plan your trip in advance andwhen you're in town.
	       <ul>•	Take The "T": Boston's public transportation system is operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, but locals know it simply as the "T". It offers subway, bus, trolley car and boat service to just about everywhere in the Greater Boston area and beyond. Subway stops are color coded - Red Line, Green Line, Blue Line, Orange Line or Silver Line.</ul>
	       <ul>•	Commuter Rail: Operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Boston's Commuter Rail services the outlying Boston suburbs. Service is available from several T stations, but most departures take place at South Station, North Station or Back Bay Station. Phone: 617.722.3200</ul>
      <p>If you are staying inside the city—or really anywhere close—for only a week or a few days, there really is no need for a car. Most hotels on the outskirts of Boston and in the suburbs have parking lots where you can leave the car—for free or for a fee, depending on the hotel—and use Boston’s first-class public transportation system to get around.</p>

        <h3>Boston Food</h3>
        <p>The labyrinthine streetscape. The novel-length menus. The confusing storefronts. There are many reasons why local diners overlook the vibrant Chinatown scene, but it all starts with the fact that it can be difficult to simply figure the place out. Well, no more. Having consulted the experts and eaten our way across the area, we present Chinatown's hidden treasures.</p>
